1. [Find-S algorithm](https://github.com/dheerajjc34/VTU-ML-Lab/tree/master/1) <br>
   Implement and demonstratethe FIND-Salgorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.

2. [Candidate-Elimination algorithm](https://github.com/dheerajjc34/VTU-ML-Lab/tree/master/2)<br>
   For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithmto output a description of the set of all  hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

3. ID3 algorithm<br>
   Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
   
4. Backpropagation algorithm<br>
Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.

5. Na誰ve Bayesian classifier<br>
Write a program to implement the na誰ve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.

6. Na誰ve Bayesian classifier with packages<br>
Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the na誰ve Bayesian Classifier model to perform this task. Built-in Java classes/API can be used to write the program. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.

7. Bayesian network<br>
Write a program to construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease dataset. You can use Java/Python ML library classes/API.

8. EM and k-Means algorithm<br>
Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python ML library classes/API in the program.

9. k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm<br>
Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can be used for this problem.

10. Locally Weighted Regression algorithm
Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm in order to fit data points. Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
